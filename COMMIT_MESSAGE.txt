feat: Implement advanced layout renderers for flexible campaign displays [CHANGE-003]

Implements complete set of sponsor display renderers for pay-what-you-want
campaigns with size-ordered, amount-ordered, and word cloud layouts.

See CHANGELOG.md [CHANGE-003] for complete details.

COMPONENTS ADDED:
- TextSponsor: Reusable text sponsor display with tooltip support
- LogoSponsor: Reusable logo sponsor display with tooltip support
- SizeOrderedRenderer: Sorts sponsors by display size (xlarge → small)
- AmountOrderedRenderer: Sorts sponsors by amount paid (highest first)
- WordCloudRenderer: Artistic spiral positioning algorithm

REFACTORING:
- FlexibleLayoutRenderer: Refactored to delegation pattern (112 → 53 lines)
- Removed inline rendering logic, added switch-based delegation
- Maintains backward compatibility, no breaking changes

FEATURES:
- Dark theme styling (#2a2a2a, #3a3a3a backgrounds, #C8102E accents)
- Logo approval filtering (only approved logos displayed)
- Pending payment states (60% opacity)
- Hover effects with scale transforms
- Support for text-only, logo-only, and mixed display types
- Tooltip integration for sponsor messages
- Empty state handling

TECHNICAL:
- Word cloud uses spiral positioning: angle = index * 0.5, radius = 20 + index * 15
- Dynamic container sizing with boundary checking
- React hooks: useEffect, useRef, useState for positioning
- TypeScript type safety for all components
- No new dependencies (uses existing React and Ant Design)

DOCUMENTATION:
- Update ROADMAP_STATUS.md: Mark "Advanced Layout Renderers" as COMPLETE
